<p>As I mentioned on the main page, this site was created to document my research and learning path.  It helps me to solidfy knowledge and hoepfully others will benefit from it as well.  I am a firm believer of knowledge should be shared and so this is my attempt at that.</p>

<p><img class="profile-picture" src="/assets/images/about-1.png" /></p>

<p>I began my adventure with Computers around the age of 14, at least this was the age I recieved my first computer.  Prior to this, I would take apart any piece of electronics in the house and put it back together again!  I went through high school, college and straight into work.  Through many career meanders I am now a security consutlant for a large security consutlancy in the UK.</p>

<p>Some things I like to do when I am not working with computers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outdoor activities (Canoing/Kyaking, walking, adventuring)</li>
  <li>My Dog (link to a picture of her)</li>
  <li>Gardening</li>
  <li>Home related stuff (Since buying my own home</li>
</ul>
