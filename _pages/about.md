## About The Site

As I mentioned on the main page, this site was created to document my research and learning path.  It helps me to solidfy knowledge by documenting what I learn and do, hopefully others will benefit from it as well.  I am a firm believer that knowledge should be shared and so this is my attempt at that.  For the time being I plan to utilise this as a platform to write blog posts and write-ups of challenges that I have completed.  I have separated the challenges out from the blog posts for the people whom don't want to spoil their challenge experiences.  This may or may not turn into something more, but for now, enjoy your stay.


## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/assets/images/about-1.png">

I began my adventure with Computers around the age of 14, at least this was the age I recieved my first computer.  Prior to this, I would take apart any piece of electronics in the house and put it back together again!  I went through high school, college and straight into work.  Through many career moves I am now a security consultant for a large security consutlancy based in the UK.

Some things I like to do when I am not working with computers:

* Spend time with my family
* Outdoor activities (Canoeing/Kayaking, Walking and general Adventuring!)
* Spending time with my amazing dog!
* Gardening; As of late, especially since the lockdown I have grown a liking for gardening; growing fruit and vegetables.

## Reading

I love to read! As such, I would like to document my book collection, and the books I am currently reading.  I think this will help others whom are thinking of purchasing/reading certain books.  Also find it useful to see my reading habbits over time.  Somewhat like a cyber-book club!

## Home Network

My home network; I believe this deserves a spot within my site as it is the first home network that is actually in my own home.  I became a homeowner last year and as such my home network has grown into something I believe worth documenting.. this is to be continued..
