                <h2 id="about-the-site">About The Site</h2>

<p>As I mentioned on the main page, this site was created to document my research and learning path.  It helps me to solidfy knowledge by documenting what I learn and do, hopefully others will benefit from it as well.  I am a firm believer that knowledge should be shared and so this is my attempt at that.  For the time being I plan to utilise this as a platform to write blog posts and write-ups of challenges that I have completed.  I have separated the challenges out from the blog posts for the people whom donâ€™t want to spoil their challenge experiences.  This may or may not turn into something more, but for now, enjoy your stay.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p><img class="profile-picture" src="/assets/images/about-1.png" /></p>

<p>I began my adventure with Computers around the age of 14, at least this was the age I recieved my first computer.  Prior to this, I would take apart any piece of electronics in the house and put it back together again!  I went through high school, college and straight into work.  Through many career moves I am now a security consultant for a large security consutlancy based in the UK.</p>

<p>Some things I like to do when I am not working with computers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spend time with my family</li>
  <li>Outdoor activities (Canoeing/Kayaking, Walking and general Adventuring!)</li>
  <li>Spending time with my amazing dog!</li>
  <li>Gardening; As of late, especially since the lockdown I have grown a liking for gardening; growing fruit and vegetables.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>I love to read! As such, I would like to document my book collection, and the books I am currently reading.  I think this will help others whom are thinking of purchasing/reading certain books.  Also find it useful to see my reading habbits over time.  Somewhat like a cyber-book club!</p>

<h2 id="home-network">Home Network</h2>

<p>My home network; I believe this deserves a spot within my site as it is the first home network that is actually in my own home.  I became a homeowner last year and as such my home network has grown into something I believe worth documenting.. this is to be continued..</p>
